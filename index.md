## Abstract
We present DeepISP, a full end-to-end deep neural
model of the camera image signal processing (ISP) pipeline. Our
model learns a mapping from the raw low-light mosaiced image
to the final visually compelling image and encompasses low-level
tasks such as demosaicing and denoising as well as higher-level
tasks such as color correction and image adjustment. The training
and evaluation of the pipeline were performed on a dedicated
dataset containing pairs of low-light and well-lit images captured
by a Samsung S7 smartphone camera in both raw and processed
JPEG formats. The proposed solution achieves state-of-the-art
performance in objective evaluation of PSNR on the subtask of
joint denoising and demosaicing. For the full end-to-end pipeline,
it achieves better visual quality compared to the manufacturer
ISP, in both a subjective human assessment and when rated by
a deep model trained for assessing image quality.

## Dataset
You must be logged in to kaggle.com for the download to start. <br /> 
For each scene there are 4 images ./id/medium_expusure.dng ./id/medium_expusure.jpg ./id/short_expusure1.dng ./id/short_expusure.jpg. <br /> 
I also have more data not included - jpg and dng for longer exposure and 5 more short exposure dng images for each scene. Please contact me if you are intersted in this data. eli.shw at gmail.
